    # MYYY PLAN!!

    # well since the robot can only conpare 2 items at a time and only hold one at a time i decied to use insertion sort i think but i would have to make new varibable right?

# Decide if we should use recursion to solve the problem by looking for clues in the problem description.
    # i dont think so at least not for the first pass
# Find similar problems that we’ve already solved and analyze those problems to see if they help us solve this problem.
    # i couldnt find anythign too useful - mainly because i am not sure what sorting method to use --- maybe BUBBLE SORT // takes longer idk
# Draw a diagram for a small input and study the diagram to help understand any potential solutions.
    # on paper
# If we use recursion, discover the base case or base cases.
# If we use recursion, discover the recursive case.
# Write out our algorithm as pseudocode.
# EXAMPLE FROM TK
# def bubble_sort(arr):
    # Your code here
    # swapped = True // how do i do this without delcaring a variable (it could be self.item?? try it?)

# Change each line of pseudocode into actual code.
# Test out our code and see if it is returning the outputs that we would expect.

# okay this is the real one

# first robot lets call him rob for short
# Rob picks up 1 card the last one on the left
# Rob then comapares the card to his right
# after computing which card is less
# Rob swaps them if needed
# he countues to do this until the end of the list decrementing “the end of the list” by 1 each time).
# do this until list is of length 1
# then they should be sorted!
